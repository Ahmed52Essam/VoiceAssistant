    participant User
    participant Assistant as VoiceAssistant
    participant TTS as TextToSpeech
    participant Recognizer as SpeechRecognizer
    participant Processor as CommandProcessor
    participant Registry as CommandRegistry
    participant Command as VoiceCommand (from commands.py)

    User->>Assistant: run()
    Assistant->>TTS: speak("Voice Assistant is now running...")

    loop Command Loop
        Assistant->>Recognizer: listen_for_command()
        Recognizer-->>Assistant: recognized_text

            Command->>TTS: speak(...)
            Command->>System: perform action (e.g., open app, type text)
        else No match (UnknownCommand)
            Processor->>Command: execute(recognized_text, tts, recognizer)
            Command->>TTS: speak("Sorry, can't recognize this command")
        end
